# Data Science & Analytics – Task 1 (2026)
By Future Interns
Business Sales Performance Analytics

About the Task
In this real-world internship task, you will work with business sales data to perform the kind of analysis that data analysts do for real companies, startups, and agencies.

Your goal is not just to create charts, but to help a business answer important questions such as:

Which products generate the most revenue?
How do sales change over time?
Which categories or regions are most profitable?
Where should the business focus to grow faster?
This task is designed so that even beginners can start, while still being valuable in real job and freelance scenarios.

You do not need advanced coding skills.
You need curiosity, logical thinking, and willingness to learn analytics tools

✅ What You’ll Do
During this task, you will:

Clean and organize raw sales data (Excel or CSV format)
Analyze:
Revenue trends over time
Top-selling products
High-value categories or regions
Build a professional, client-ready dashboard or analysis report
Write clear insights and recommendations as if you are advising a real business
🛠️ Tools You Can Use (Flexible)
You may use any one or a combination of the following tools:

Power BI
Tableau
Microsoft Excel
Python (optional, for advanced analysis)
There is no restriction on tools — just like real analyst roles.

🎯 Skills You’ll Gain
By completing this task, you will build practical skills such as:

Data cleaning & preparation
Business-focused KPI analysis
Trend and performance analysis
Insight generation and reporting
Business storytelling using data
These are core skills required in analytics jobs and freelance projects.

To get the maximum value from this task, don’t limit yourself to online datasets.

Many of our interns and freelancers start exactly this way.
